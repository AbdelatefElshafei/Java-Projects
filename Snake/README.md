# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Java using the `javax.swing` library. The game features a snake that grows in length as it eats apples, and the player must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without crashing.

## Code Structure

The main class is `GamePanel.java`, which handles the game logic, rendering, and user input. Here are the key methods:

- `startGame()`: Initializes the game and starts the timer.
- `draw(Graphics g)`: Renders the game components (snake, apple, grid, and score).
- `move()`: Updates the snake's position based on the current direction.
- `checkApple()`: Checks if the snake has eaten an apple and updates the score.
- `checkCollisions()`: Checks for collisions with walls or the snake's body.
- `gameOver(Graphics g)`: Displays the game over screen with the final score.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following constants in the `GamePanel` class:

- **Grid Size**: Change `SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`, and `UNIT_SIZE` to adjust the grid dimensions.
- **Game Speed**: Adjust the `DELAY` constant to change the speed of the game.
- **Colors**: Modify the `Color` values in the `draw()` method to customize the snake, apple, and background colors.
